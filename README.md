## What is Dahlia?

_Dahlia is a leveraged yield farming protocol that offers **yield farmers **access to as much as 9x leverage when providing liquidity to a decentralized exchange on Celo. _

In return, the protocol is able to offer incredibly high interest rate to lenders without the direct risks of yield farming. Hence, the Dahlia protocol supports it DeFi on Celo in two ways. One by directly by offering high interest rates on idle assets, and indirectly by acting as a liquidity engine for the ecosystem, enabling greater capital formation and price discovery.
