## What is Pinnata?

_Pinnata is a leveraged yield farming protocol that offers **yield farmers** access to leverage when providing liquidity to a decentralized exchange on Celo._&#x20;

In return, the protocol is able to offer incredibly high interest rate to lenders without the direct risks of yield farming. On one side, lenders lend out their assets in a traditional DeFi money market with variable interest rates based on utilization rate and no locking period. On the other end, more risk-seeking traders can enter a farming position on any of the supported protocols, borrowing from the money market and using their existing position as collateral. In the case that the borrow is worth more than the collateral multiplied by some safety factor, the borrows are liquidated and the lenders are protected. Hence, the Pinnata protocol supports DeFi on Celo in two ways. One by directly by offering high interest rates on idle assets, and indirectly by acting as a liquidity engine for the ecosystem, enabling greater capital formation and price discovery.
