# Audit and Risks

We were audited by Braham Systems on July 2nd, 2021. You can see the report **here**.

## Admin Keys

Dahlia admin keys are controlled by a 2/3 multisig. The signers are Kyle Scott, Robert Leifke, and Brian Li. This multisig has capabilities to pause new deposits and farming in case of technical emergencies. Users will always be able to withdraw their funds regardless of new deposits being paused. The multisig can also whitelist new assets on Fountain of Youth

## Impermanent Loss

Although using Dahlia to leverage can provide an opportunity to maximize returns on liquidity provisioning. The volatility of the tokens themselves pose very serious threat to earning any yields. In fact, it exposes users to bottomless losses if the token themselves experience a massive drawdown and the user swaps out of their position. 

## Liquidation

Any user that takes on leverage is exposed to liquidation risk. In this case, if the debt ratio goes over 100% on any position, the user immediately is at risk of getting liquidated. 

## Immutable Code

One of the merits and demerits of code that lives on a blockchain is its immutable nature. That means funds lost due to sending funds to a wrong address or otherwise cannot be reversed.
