# Bridged Assets

The evolved version of Dahlia will support a variety of ERC-20 tokens from other chains. In order to reduce risk for users, we will primarily be integrated with assets transferred over trustless bridges.  

As of right now, Dahlia does NOT support any pools or assets that have been bridged over. This will be supported once we get safe oracles up and running. 

## Optics 

For the past year the Optics team at cLabs has been working incredibly hard to bring a superior cross-domain messaging standard for which **trustless** token bridges can be built on. We are excited to see that the initial Celo <> Ethereum <> Polygon bridges are finally here! 

Although the contracts are live, their GUI is still in development. That said, due to the wonderful development work of Dylan from Mobius Money,  users can already transfer their Polygon and Ethereum assets to Celo through the bridge UI accessible through the Dahlia interface.

To see the deployed contracts on mainnet, please refer to their Github and blockscout.

### Expected confirmation times and transfer costs 

At the moment, the Optics bridges are still in Alpha. Meaning that the tooling and technology is still in its infancy. Therefore, to no surprise there has been some growing pains. One of those is long confirmation times. The wait times are as follows;

Polygon USDC transfers over Optics:** Between 4-20 hours**

Ethereum USDC transfers over Optics: **Between 4-8 hours**

## **Celer Network**

By the end of the October, we will be working with the Mobius team to add the Celer 2.0 bridge to the aggregator UI.  This means that anyone can transfer there assets from any of their supported chains. This includes;

* Ethereum
* Optimism
* Arbitrium
* xDai 
* Polygon
* Avalanche

Best part, this will include** 5 minute maximum confirmation times** on any ERC-20 transfer from any chain.
