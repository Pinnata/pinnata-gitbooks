# Connecting Wallets

In order to use the Mobius exchange, you must setup and connect to a Celo wallet. Mobius currently supports Valora, Ledger, Celo Web Extension, Metamask, and Wallet Connect. 

## Desktop Users

Our desktop users have the widest range of options. For simplest set up and use, we recommend Metamask. For extra security we recommend Ledger.

Web Extension Wallet:** **Make sure you have selected your wallet of choice on the web extension pop-up menu. Once you are on Mobius, click 'Connect to Wallet' in the lower left corner, then click 'Celo Web Extension.' The Celo Web Extension pop-up menu should appear; click 'Allow.' Your wallet address should appear in the lower left corner. 

Ledger Hardware Wallet: First, you need to download the 'Celo app' to your device ([guide](https://docs.celo.org/celo-owner-guide/ledger)). Connect your device to your computer via USB, unlock it, and launch the Celo app. On the Mobius website, click 'Connect to Wallet' in the lower left corner, then click 'Ledger.'  Select the wallet index of your choice, then you should see your wallet address in the lower left corner.
