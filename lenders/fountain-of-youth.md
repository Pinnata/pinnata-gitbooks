# Fountain of Youth

In order for yield farmers to access the highest possible leverage,  fully functioning fork of the Iron Bank. This will enable farmers to access deep under-collateralized liquidity.

Providing users the benefit of access some of highest and safest yields in the Celo ecosystem.  

## Interest rate formulas

**Borrow Interest Rate** ​= Multiplier∗min(Ua​,Kink)+Jump Multiplier∗max(0,Ua​−Kink)+Base Rate​

**Supply Interest Rate** ​= Borrowing Interest Ratea​∗Ua​∗(1−Reserve Factora​)

* **Reserve factor:** 0.0
* **Base Rate: **0.08
* **Multiplier:** 0.4
* **Jump Rate:** 2.0
* **Kink:** 0.75
