# Opening a farm position

## There are four steps to opening a farming position.

\(1\) Select a farming pool

\(2️\) Supply liquidity

\(3️\) Select leverage amount with toggle

\(4️\) Confirm strategy

That's it!

## 1\) Select a pool

Dahlia V1 will enable leveraged yield farming of liquidity pools that are on **Ubeswap, Mobius, Symmetric, and Sushiswap** initially. Then once **Curve** and **Saddle** go live, those too! Users can select any of the aforementioned pools on Dashboard page.

For instance, if “Ubeswap's UBE-CELO pool” is selected, the transaction will be executed on the UBE-CELO pool on Ubeswap.

## 2\) Supply Liquidity

Enter the amount willing to supply to farming. As the picture indicated, a user can press the green "max" button an enter the full amount, or manually add a desired number. Please note, in order to continue, a user must supply a similar amount in value of each token in order to continue.
