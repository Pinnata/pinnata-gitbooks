## Yield farming pools with leverage <a id="leveraged-yield-farming-pools-more-than-1x"></a>

A user to farming for rewards in the form of LP tokens on top of fees earned from the pool itself is entering a "yield farming pool." As such the breakdown of the APY is;

* Trading fees
* LP \(reward\) tokens

## Liquidity providing pools with leverage  <a id="leveraged-liquidity-providing-pools-more-than-1x"></a>

* Trading fees

## Providing liquidity with no leverage  <a id="yield-farming-pools-with-no-leverage-1-x-only"></a>
